# Robot Log Enhancer ðŸ¤–

Robot Log Enhancer is a JavaScript module designed to enhance the log.html files generated by [Robot Framework](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework). It adds a footer to the log page and provides additional functionality to improve the test result analysis experience.

This is a fork of https://github.com/brequet/robot-log-enhancer-module.

## Features

- Automatically collapses all children of the "Wait Until Keyword Succeeds" keyword except for the last one, focusing on the final failing example.
- Adds navigation buttons to move between failing tests (previous/next), with keyboard support (left/right arrow keys).
- Includes a button to open a modal that allows copying failing tests as command-line arguments, making it easy to rerun only the failed tests.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/robot-log-enhancer.git

   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   yarn install
   ```

3. Build the module:

This will create the `dist/robot-log-enhancer.umd.js` file.

## Usage

To use the Robot Log Enhancer in your Robot Framework log.html file, you need to import the JavaScript module. You can do this by adding a script tag to the log.html file, either with the content of the generated script or with a path to the JS file.

Example:

```html
<script src="C:\path\robot-log-enhancer-module\dist\robot-log-enhancer.umd.js"></script>
```

Make sure to adjust the path according to your project structure.
